# College-Connect
College Connect is a community-building web application developed as a mini-project.  It helps college students connect with peers who share similar hobbies and interests, enabling them to build communities, share creative work, and collaborate on events or discussions.

College Connect is the name of our web application which allows us to connect with students sharing a same hobby. Using this people can view work done by other people a creative aspect. This application would allow its users to talk and share their experiences with other people too. The motive behind this project is to bring people closer to each other such that students can collaborate, learn and become productive with their creativity. College is a diverse eco system of students and studies. Creativity, hobbies and passion are easy to get lost while engrossed in the tedious eco system of college. It is also observed that people with similar hobbies tend to be more inclined and understanding with the same traits. Thus, college connect presents an easy and hassle-free way to interact and join people. It is also observed that students make a very small group of friends in college. Due to such a preference, it becomes more unlikely for students to find friends of similar taste. Colleges with huge strength of students are more likely to face such an issue. “College Connect” would also help in its users to reach out to a bigger audience to showcase their talents and turn hobbies into profitable businesses. It also helps in building communities in college. Such communities can easily host events, share ideas, build projects and increase their understanding about a topic or activity in general.
